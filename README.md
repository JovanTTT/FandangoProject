# Fandango Movie Ratings Analysis

This project investigates the accuracy of Fandango's movie ratings by comparing them to other rating platforms. The analysis highlights discrepancies that suggest Fandango was inflating movie ratings, providing insights into how movie ratings can be manipulated.

## Project Overview

Fandango is a popular movie ticketing service, but in recent years, it faced criticism for displaying inflated movie ratings. This project aims to analyze and compare Fandango's movie ratings with ratings from other platforms to determine if there was any bias or manipulation.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs and visualizations.

## Data Sources

- Fandango's movie ratings from [Year].
- Comparison data from other movie rating platforms (e.g., IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes).

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered movie ratings data from Fandango and other platforms.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and structured the data using Pandas.
3. **Analysis**: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to compare ratings using NumPy for computations.
4. **Visualization**: Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations that highlight discrepancies in ratings.

## Key Findings

- **Inflated Ratings**: The analysis revealed that Fandango's ratings were consistently higher compared to other platforms.
- **Bias Indicators**: The distribution of ratings suggests a bias towards inflating ratings for certain movies.
- **Impact on Consumers**: These inflated ratings could mislead consumers into perceiving movies as better than they actually are.

## Results

Visualizations and statistical analysis showed that Fandango's ratings were often skewed, raising questions about the transparency and accuracy of their rating system.
